                his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</td>

                concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international technical standard,
                jointly defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</td>
